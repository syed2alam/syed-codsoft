          <p>
           The craft has diversified over time; in addition to the traditional ivory-wood, other woods—including rubber, sycamore, cedar, pine and teak—are now used as well.Manufacturing stages include procuring the wood, seasoning the wood, cutting the wood into the desired shapes, pruning and carving the toys, applying the colours and finally polishing the finished product. Vegetable dyes are used in the colouring process to ensure that the toys and dolls are safe for use by children.As of Oct 2011, Channapatna had a population of 71,902,in which 254 in home manufacturing units and 50 in small factories, were engaged in the making of these toys. The Karnataka Handicrafts Development Corporation (KHDC) provides assistance with marketing efforts. The oldest and most popular manufacturing unit Bharath art and crafts help develop innovative products.

          <p>
            There are many reasons wooden toys are better—not only for your child, but for the environment as well. They’re more durable (yielding less waste than their plastic counterparts), biodegradable and may even be made with sustainable wood. Good quality, eco-friendly wooden toys also don’t contain PVC, phthalates, or similar chemicals used in plastic toys. Be aware, however, of cheap, low-quality wood. Some are made from plywood that’s full of toxic glues and leach formaldehyde. Lack of quality control on these cheaper materials means there’s a high probability that paints tainted with lead were used, as well.
